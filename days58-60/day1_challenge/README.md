This program is to log my 100days of progress code based on talk python #1000days of code course.

It will get the course outline from the page (using requests and beautiful soup)

https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_100days_in_python/100-days-of-code-in-python

Once it has the outline data, it will ask user to enter the current progress day. I've started my #100daysofcode 
on Apr 20, 2018. So the program will log the course titles till the current progress day in the below format

# Progress log
| Days | Completed on | Title |
| ---- | ------------ | ------|
|      |              |       |
